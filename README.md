# MIPS 32 bits in VHDL
Basic MIPS microprocessor of 32 bits programmed in VHDL.

This is an implementation of a basic 32 bits MIPS microprocessor with its register file of 32 registers of 32 bits, two memories: one for the data (a RAM) and other for the instructions (a ROM), an ALU, etc.
It is a single cycle without pipeline implementation and doesn't have floating point operations.
The implementation is fully operational and can be programmed with the MIPS 32 assembly.
